Developed by psychoanalyst Aaron Beck in the 1950s, CBT is based on the premise that cognitive distortions (unhelpful or irrational thoughts and beliefs) contribute significantly to psychological distress.\\n\\n## Key Characteristics\\n- **Problem-focused and action-oriented**: Unlike psychoanalytic approaches that explore unconscious meanings, CBT directly addresses specific problems related to diagnosed mental disorders\\n- **Emphasis on present issues**: Focuses on current thought patterns rather than past experiences\\n- **Collaborative approach**: Therapist works with client to identify goals and develop strategies\\n- **Time-limited**: Typically shorter in duration than other therapeutic approaches\\n\\n## Theoretical Foundation\\n- Combines principles from behavioral and cognitive psychology\\n- Rooted in the understanding that thoughts influence feelings and behaviors\\n- Philosophical influences include:\\n  - Ancient Stoicism (particularly influencing Beck and Ellis)\\n  - John Stuart Mill's Associationism\\n  - Buddhist principles (influencing newer CBT variants)\\n\\n## Treatment Applications\\nCBT has been effectively applied to treat numerous conditions, including:\\n- Depression\\n- Anxiety disorders\\n- Post-traumatic stress disorder\\n- Obsessive-compulsive disorder\\n- Substance use disorders\\n- Eating disorders\\n- Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\\n- Marital problems\\n\\n## Effectiveness and Recommendations\\n- Comparable effectiveness to psychoactive medications for less severe forms of depression and borderline personality disorder\\n- Often most effective when combined with medication for major depressive disorder\\n- Recommended as first-line treatment for most psychological disorders in children and adolescents\\n- Endorsed by major professional organizations including:\\n  - American Psychiatric Association\\n  - American Psychological Association\\n  - British National Health Service\\n\\n## Variants and Evolution\\nCBT has evolved into several specialized approaches, including:\\n- Dialectical behavior therapy\\n- Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy\\n- Spiritually-based CBT\\n- Compassion-focused therapy\\n\\n## Criticisms\\nDespite widespread use, critics argue that:\\n- Benefits may be overstated\\n- Treatment effects can be small or diminishing\\n- High dropout rates occur in some populations\\n- Methodological flaws exist in some research\\n- Neoliberal influences may affect treatment approach\\n\\n## Historical Development\\nCBT emerged from two major therapeutic traditions:\\n1. **Behavioral therapy** (early 20th century):\\n   - Rooted in Watson and Rayner's conditioning studies\\n   - Advanced by Mary Cover Jones' work on unlearning fears\\n   - Further developed by Joseph Wolpe in the 1950s\\n\\n2. **Cognitive therapy** (1960s):\\n   - Developed by Aaron Beck\\n   - Eventually merged with behavioral approaches to form modern CBT\\n\\nDespite criticisms, CBT remains one of the most widely used, evidence-supported therapeutic approaches in contemporary mental health treatment.\", name='create_summary', id='ecc97226-9139-4a44-bddf-4516dceaa679', tool_call_id='toolu_019SVQf65ekjCE6yU2HNmkKq')]}}\n",
