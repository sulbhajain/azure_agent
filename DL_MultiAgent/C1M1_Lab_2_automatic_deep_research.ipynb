    "Welcome to this new practice lab! By now you should have a clearer view of the elements that compose a multi-agent system. In this lab you will get to put it into action by creating your first crew.\n",

    "**What you'll learn:**\n",
    "- How to define agents with specific roles and expertise\n",
    "- How to provide agents with tools to perform their tasks\n",
    "- How to create your own tasks that agents will execute\n",
    "- How to assemble agents and tasks into a Crew, all using CrewAI\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "As a research consultant, you're constantly tasked with producing comprehensive reports on diverse topics for demanding clients. You need to build an automatic deep research solution that can rapidly gather, verify, and synthesize information from across the internet, delivering reliable, fact-checked reports that meet tight deadlines and exacting standards regardless of the subject matter. \n",
    "\n",
    "## General instructions\n",
    "In this lab you will be presented with a structure of the code, but you will need to complete some of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "To successfully run this lab, replace all instances of the placeholder `None` with your own code. Sections where you need to write code will be delimited between `### START CODE HERE ###` and `### END CODE HERE ###`.\n",
